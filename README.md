## Calculator

**A calculator browser app.**

**Aims:**
Putting together JavaScript, HTML and CSS knowledge so far to make an on-screen calculator.

**Outcomes:**
- Things started to get more confusing as more functionality was added to the calculator - it was necessary to refactor several functions. Although this was good for practice, it may have been wiser to start out with more of a plan for how to implement the more complicated aspects first.

**Demo:**
